Assignment 3: Functions & Modules in Python

This repository includes two tasks:



Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

Write a Python program that:
1. Defines a function named factorial() that takes a number as an argument.
2. Calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
3. Returns the calculated factorial.
4. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

Write a Python program that:
1. Takes an integer input from the user.
2. Calculates and displays:
   - The square root of the number.
   - The natural logarithm (log base e).
   - The sine of the number (in radians).
